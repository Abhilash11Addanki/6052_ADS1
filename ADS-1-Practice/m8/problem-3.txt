Which method runs faster for an array with all keys identical, basic selection sort or basic insertion sort ?

When the keys are identical, then basic insertion sort works faster as we break the the statement whenever the if condition doesn't satisfy.
We come out of this loop where as in selection sort, we keep performing the for loop for all the identical keys.
